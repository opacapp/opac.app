                    <p>If your library is not in our list, this can be for two reasons:</p>

                            this case, you should ask us whether we could support the library.

                    barcode scanner app to search by ISBN. We aim to support as many barcode scanner apps as possible,

                <div><p>While the adding of new libraries is not hard, there is still some technical configuration to be
                    adjusted. This would not only look irritating in the app’s user interface, but also make it very
                    hard to track down errors. We believe it would do more harm than help, so we do not provide this
                    possibility.</p>

                <div><p>This answer depends on the library. The rule of thumb is that the encryption level is exactly
                    the same as when you access your library’s website with your phone’s web browser. </p>
                    <p>Starting with version 2.0.32, the app displays a yellow warning when creating or changing an

            I don't receive notifications for expiring lent items. What is the reason for this?
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body" style="">
            <div class="collapsible-inner">
                <div>
                    <p>There are multiple possible reasons. We have listed some common ones below:</p>
                    <ul class="browser-default">
                        <li>First of all, expiration notifications need to be enabled in the app's settings.</li>
                        <li>If lent items are not correctly displayed in the app's “account” view
                            (particularly without or with a wrong return date), the app is not able to send
                            notifications. Please contact us via email in this case.</li>
                        <li>Notifications for the Web Opac App could have been disabled in the device's settings.
                            This setting can be found in the “Settings” app under “Apps”.</li>
                        <li>A “do not disturb” mode available on some smartphones could also block the app's
                            notifications. This can also be disabled in the Settings app</li>
                        <li>Notifications could also be blocked by a third-party app, e.g. an antivirus software.
                            Please also check the settings of such apps.</li>
                        <li>Some smartphone manufacturers add energy saving features to their devices that aggressively
                            terminate apps running in the background. This can also interfere with notifications from
                            the Web Opac App. In this case, notifications either don't appear at all or they appear only
                            when the app is started. Please try to deactivate these energy saving features or exclude
                            the Web Opac App from them. For example, Huawei smartphones label this setting as
                            “Protected Apps”.</li>
