                The app allows to easily search the catalogue of over 1,000 public and scientific libraries worldwide.
                All search filters of the respective catalogues are supported and search results can be saved locally
                to a bookmark list for later reference. Using a barcode scanning app you can directly scan the ISBN barcode
                of a book and search for it in your favourite library.

            <p class="light">
                In most libraries, the app is able to directly access member accounts and therefore allows you to
                conveniently look at the books you lent out and find out their return date. Books can be renewed directly
                from the app and you can directly place reservations on search results. Multiple accounts in one or
                even different libraries are supported at the same time.

            <p class="light">
                The app helps you to avoid expensive fines: If activated, the app regularly checks your library account
                in the background and sends a notification as soon as a book must be returned soon. To return the book,
                the app assists you with quick access to the library's website and opening hours. Returning books on time
                never was this easy!

            <p class="description light">
                With the Plus Edition of our app, we have a special offer to libraries: In addition to the features
                of the free app these apps may includes a full integration of services like Onleihe oder Overdrive,
                improved integration of opening hours of the branches and features like acquisition lists, event
                calendars or news from the library. For some libraries, we realised individual features – as diverse
                as the libraries themselves. We have been able to bring libraries of every size into the modern age.
