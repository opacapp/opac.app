                <h2>App disclaimer</h2>

                <p>
                    We took care when developing the app and test it regularly. However, due to the huge number of
                    supported libraries, it is not possible for us to test all cases that might occur. We therefore
                    exclude any liability for damage caused by using the app. Especially, we are not liable if fines
                    are imposed because the user completely relied on the app's reminder feature. For technical reasons,
                    we cannot give a 100% guarantee here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We try to achieve completeness, correctness and currentness of all data shown by the app, but we
                    are not able to guarantee it, since technical failures are impossible to predict. As soon as we
                    gain knowledge of a bug, we work on a timely fix. All contents of the app (search results,
                    links, etc.) are directly displayed from the library's data and we cannot influence those contents.
                    Therefore, we exclude any liability associated with that data.
                </p>
