Download
========

We discourage direct APK file downloads, since you won't receive any bug-correcting updates for the app this way.
We recommend downloading the app on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.geeksfactory.opacclient).
In case this is not possible for you due to lack of a Google account or a Play Store on your device, you can also find
our app in the free app store [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=opac&fdid=de.geeksfactory.opacclient),
although we cannot guarantee that there will always be timely updates for our app there, since this is outside of
our control

Still, if you need to, you can find the recent APK file here:
