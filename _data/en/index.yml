promo_catalogue_search_title: Catalogue search
promo_catalogue_search_desc: >
  The app allows to easily search the catalogue of over 1,000 public and scientific libraries worldwide. All search
  filters of the respective catalogues are supported and search results can be saved locally to a bookmark list for
  later reference. Using a barcode scanning app you can directly scan the ISBN barcode of a book and search for it in
  your favourite library.
promo_account_title: Account features
promo_account_desc: >
  In most libraries, the app is able to directly access member accounts and therefore allows you to conveniently look
  at the books you lent out and find out their return date. Books can be renewed directly from the app and you can
  directly place reservations on search results. Multiple accounts in one or even different libraries are supported at
  the same time.
promo_reminder_title: Reminder
promo_reminder_desc: >
  The app helps you to avoid expensive fines: If activated, the app regularly checks your library account in the
  background and sends a notification as soon as a book must be returned soon. To return the book, the app assists you
  with quick access to the library's website and opening hours. Returning books on time never was this easy!

  Tailor-made apps for single libraries
plusshowcase_plus_desc: >
  With the Plus Edition of our app, we have a special offer to libraries: In addition to the features of the free app
  these apps may includes a full integration of services like Onleihe oder Overdrive, improved integration of opening
  hours of the branches and features like acquisition lists, event calendars or news from the library. For some
  libraries, we realised individual features – as diverse as the libraries themselves. We have been able to bring
  libraries of every size into the modern age. <a href="/{{ page.lang }}/for-libraries/">Read more</a>
