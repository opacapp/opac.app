disclaimer1: >
  We took great care with assembling this website. However, we can not take any liability for the absence of errors,
  for the correctness, completeness, currentness or accuracy of this website. We exclude liability for all harm caused
  by using this website.
disclaimer2: >
  All page contents are the property of the page authors. Reproducing, editing or distributing the contents require
  permission of the page author. Downloads and copies of the page are allowed for private use. Any contents on this page
  not created by the page's authors are marked appropriately. Should you however notice a copyright infringement on this
  website, we kindly ask you to contact us. We will remove such contents as fast as possible.
disclaimer3: >
  All external pages that are linked from this website are outside of our control. At the time we created the links,
  they did not contain any visible illegal content. However, as we cannot check them all the time, we cannot assume any
  liability for them and kindly ask you to contact us, if a link on this page points to a illegal webpage. We will
  remove the link as soon as possible in this case.
app_disclaimer_title: App disclaimer
app_disclaimer1: >
  We took care when developing the app and test it regularly. However, due to the huge number of supported libraries,
  it is not possible for us to test all cases that might occur. We therefore exclude any liability for damage caused by
  using the app. Especially, we are not liable if fines are imposed because the user completely relied on the app's
  reminder feature. For technical reasons, we cannot give a 100% guarantee here.
app_disclaimer2: >
  We try to achieve completeness, correctness and currentness of all data shown by the app, but we are not able to
  guarantee it, since technical failures are impossible to predict. As soon as we gain knowledge of a bug, we work on a
  timely fix. All contents of the app (search results, links, etc.) are directly displayed from the library's data and
  we cannot influence those contents. Therefore, we exclude any liability associated with that data.
