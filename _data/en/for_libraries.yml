title: For libraries
desc1: >
  While library have online catalogues for years now, most of them are exhausting to use on a mobile device, as they
  are rarely designed for small displays and touch interaction. Our app provides a beautiful interface, natively
  integrated into the Android mobile operating system.
desc2: >
  In response to multiple requests, we now offer a Plus Edition of our app, which not only contains additional features
  but is also available for Apple iOS devices. Furthermore, the Plus Edition is branded with your library’s logo and
  colors and is available in the app stores as a single-purpose app for your library.
desc3: We are open to implement additional wishes, just contact us!
desc4: The Plus Edition is being sold by our partner, subkom GmbH.
