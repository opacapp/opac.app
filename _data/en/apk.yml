  We discourage direct APK file downloads, since you won't receive any bug-correcting updates for the app this way.
  We recommend downloading the app on
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.geeksfactory.opacclient">Google Play</a>. In case this is
  not possible for you due to lack of a Google account or a Play Store on your device, you can also find our app in the
  free app store
  <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=opac&fdid=de.geeksfactory.opacclient">F-Droid</a>,
  although we cannot guarantee that there will always be timely updates for our app there, since this is outside of
  our control.
